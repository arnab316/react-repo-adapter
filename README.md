## Better React Application
### Understanding the Design Patterns


1. **Repository Pattern**
 - The Repository Pattern abstracts the data layer, providing a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects. It mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an in-memory domain object collection.



2. **Adapter Pattern**
 - The Adapter Pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. This pattern is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.



**Structuring the Project**
- Organize the project with a clear separation of concerns. Here’s a suggested structure:
`
 src/
├── adapters/
│   └── apiAdapter.js
├── components/
│   └── ItemsComponent.js
├── repositories/
│   └── dataRepository.js
├── services/
│   └── apiService.js
├── App.js
└── index.js
